A Uniformization Theorem for compact Riemann surfaces
=====================================================

This is my Bachelor Thesis from the year 2014. It is written in German
and was handed in at Heidelberg University. The thesis is mainly based
on the book "Lectures on Riemann surfaces" by Otto Forster. Perhaps
some people find the thesis or the design of it useful.

I am a litte bit sorry about this repository. It was one of my first
and I included many files, that I would not include anymore. So the
repository looks kind of bloated. Nonetheless,  I hope you find something
interesting.
